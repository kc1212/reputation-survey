In this work, we survey both the practical and the theoretical aspects of the
Sybil attack. We demonstrate the severeness of the Sybil attack by showing the
harm it is causing in the real world. Social networks are flooded with Sybils
making real news and fake news almost indistinguishable. Users of Tor are
monitored by Sybils hidden in the network trying to reveal their real identity.
Then we define the Sybil attack using its original definition from
Douceur~\cite{douceur2002sybil} and introduce one of the most common
models---the social graph. Next, we zoom into four different systems---P2P file
sharing networks, online social networks, reputation systems and wireless ad-hoc
networks---and look the various types of attacks that can be mounted. There are
a number of alarming attacks, for instance automated identity theft,
self-promotion and so on. The main part of our work summarises the defence
mechanisms. Earlier defence mechanisms primarily work by limiting the number of
identities or the rate at which they are created. The introduction of BarterCast
inspired many network-flow based techniques for limiting the influence of
Sybils. Similarly, the introduction of SybilGuard stimulated a lot of work on
random-walk based techniques for identifying Sybils. Hybrids are also available,
for instance GateKeeper is a hybrid of the two aforementioned techniques.
Finally, we compare and contrast our work with existing surveys.

We hope this work demonstrates the alarming consequences of the Sybil attack and
many ingenious ways to defend against it. However, there does not exist a
general solution and many defence mechanisms must satisfy their own set of
assumptions in order to perform well. When the assumptions are violated, which
can be the case due to the dynamic structure of real networks, they become
ineffective (demonstrated in~\cite{liu2016smartwalk}). Moreover, almost no
defence mechanisms considers the temporal dynamics~\cite{liu2015exploiting},
i.e. the attacker may modify the attack edges or its the social graph in the
Sybil region over time. Lin et el. show the attacker can ``greatly undermine the
security guarantees'' of many defence mechanisms~\cite{liu2015exploiting}.

Without a doubt, much work still needs to be done in order for the cyberspace to
be free of the Sybil attack. We hope this work serves as a cornerstone for the
future defence mechanisms.
