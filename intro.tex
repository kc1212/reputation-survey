Electronic commerce and online social networks are common phenomenons at the
present time. They allow us to orchestrate many aspects of our lives in the
comfort of our homes, behind the monitors of our devices. An online identity is
often required to use such services, for examples we must create an account to
tweet\footnote{A message sent using Twitter is a tweet.} our friend, who must
also have an account. In this scenario, users can choose to remain psudonymous
if they are careful, where their real-life identity is uncorrelated with their
online identity. % privacy

While creating pseudonyms is useful for protecting users' privacy, it also opens
an alleyway for attackers. The Sybil attack, first described by
Douceur\cite{douceur2002sybil}, is an attack where an entity can assume multiple
identities or Sybils, and then attack either another entity or undermine the
whole system. For example, a malicious Twitter user can create many fake
identities and have the fake identities follow his real identity, thus creating
a false reputation. It is one of the most important attacks because it leads to
a large number of consequences including but not limited to spreading false
information, identity theift\cite{bilge2009all} and ballot
stuffing\cite{bhattacharjee2005avoiding}. Furthermore, to the best of our
knowledge, there is no general solution for preventing the Sybil attack.

In this work, we survey various aspects of the Sybil attack. But in contrast
with previous surveys, we include both the theoretical and practical aspects.
First, we describe the Sybil attack in more detail and and illustrate its
importance by looking at how researchers and black-hat hackers mounted the
attack on real-world e-commerce and online social network systems in
\autoref{sec:sybil}. Since there is a large variety of Sybil attack defence
mechanisms, from using trusted-third-party to exploiting the graph
characteristics in online social networks, thus we classify these mechanisms by
their ``main idea'' in \autoref{sec:defences}. Finally we present the related
work and conclude in \autoref{sec:related} and \autoref{sec:summary}.
