Electronic commerce and online social networks allow us to orchestrate many
aspects of our lives in the comfort of our homes, behind the monitors of our
devices. With such services, online identity is often required. For example in
Twitter\footnote{Twitter (\texttt{https://twitter.com/}) is a social network website
  where users can send and read short messages---called ``tweets'', users can
  also ``follow'' each other.}, users must create accounts to tweet a friend,
who must also have an account. In this scenario, users can choose to remain
pseudonymous if they are careful, where their real-life identity is uncorrelated
with their online identity. While that is useful for protecting the users'
privacy, it also opens an alleyway for attackers.

The Sybil attack, first described by Douceur\cite{douceur2002sybil}, is an
attack where an entity can assume multiple identities or sybils\footnote{In this
  work we use ``sybil'' as a noun to mean a fake identity.}, and then attack
either another entity or undermine the whole system. For example, a malicious
Twitter user can create many fake identities and have them follow his real
identity, thus creating a false reputation. It is one of the most important
attacks because it leads to a large number of consequences including but not
limited to spreading false information, identity theift\cite{bilge2009all} and
ballot stuffing\cite{bhattacharjee2005avoiding}. Furthermore, to the best of our
knowledge, there is no general solution for preventing the Sybil attack.

There has been over a decade of work on the Sybil attack from both
perspective---attackers and defenders. Many previous surveys focus only on the
defender's perspective or a particular class of defence mechanisms. The purpose
of this work is to survey and provide a broad view on all aspects of the Sybil
attack. First, we illustrate the importance of the Sybil attack by looking at
how researchers and black-hat hackers mounted the attack in the real-world; we
also experiment with fake Twitter followers and look at their properties
(\autoref{sec:motivation}). Then we define the Sybil attack give some important
theoretical results (\autoref{sec:theory}). With the fundamentals in place, we
describe the various types of attacks (\autoref{sec:attacks}) and defence
mechanisms (\autoref{sec:defences}). There is a large variety of Sybil attack
defence mechanisms, from using trusted-third-party to exploiting the graph
characteristics in online social networks, thus we classify these mechanisms by
their ``main idea''. Finally we present the related work and conclude in
\autoref{sec:related} and \autoref{sec:summary}.
