The Sybil attack is coined by Douceur\cite{douceur2002sybil} in 2002 in the
context of peer-to-peer systems. Preventing the Sybil attack is in fact a lot
more difficult because peer-to-peer systems often do not have a central, trusted
authority. So it is always possible to create new identities.

Important theoretical results:
Sybil-proof\cite{cheng2005sybilproof} - symmetric reputation functions cannot
provide Sybil-proofness, must use asymmetric reputation functions.
