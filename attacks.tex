Sybil attacks can be mounted in different applications and cause a large array
of consequences. This section categorises the attacks by the goal for four
common applications. (1) P2P (peer-to-peer) file sharing networks such as
BitTorrent, (2) OSN (online social networks) such as Twitter and Facebook, (3)
reputation systems such as eBay and (4) WANET (wireless ad-hoc networks) such as
sensor networks. We hope this section further illuminates the alarming
consequences of the Sybil attack.

\subsection{The Sybil Attack in P2P FIle Sharing Networks}
P2P (peer-to-peer) file sharing networks are distributed computer networks that
are built for discovering and sharing files. BitTorrent\cite{bep3} is likely the
most popular P2P network at the time of writing. Due to their open and
distributed nature, they are vulnerable to the Sybil attack.

\subsubsection{Index Poisoning}
P2P networks often implement a DHT (distributed hash table). The DHT in
BitTorrent is called Mainline-DHT, based on
Kademlia\cite{maymounkov2002kademlia}. Keys are the infohashes (file
identifiers) and values are the metadata of the files, these are distributed
across all the participating peers. Every node stores a routing table and
requests are routed iteratively to the node responsible for a particular
key\cite{bep5}. The goal of index poisoning is to corrupt routing table so that
honest peers fail to find the values they want. It can be mounted by injecting
Sybils into the DHT that do not follow the protocol. Wang and Kangasharju
created honeypots in the BitTorrent network and detected as many as 300,000
Sybils\cite{wang2012real}. Similar attacks are possible in other P2P networks
such as Overnet\cite{liang2006index}.

% There are no concrete proof of malicious activities, but the Sybils can easily
% sabotage the DHT if they choose to.

\subsubsection{Eclipse Attack}
Steiner et al. mounted an Eclipse attack on a Kademlia based DHT for P2P file
sharing known as KAD, it is used in Overnet and
eMule\cite{steiner2007exploiting}. The Eclipse Attack\cite{singh2006eclipse} is
a special form of targeted Sybil attack. Sybils are arranged in the network such
that they eclipse the the victim from the rest of the network. The victim can
either an identity or an object such as a key in DHT. The authors mounted the
latter variation. The authors show that it is possible to eclipse a key using
only 32 Sybils in a DHT with 1.5 million users and 42,000 key.


\subsubsection{Denial of Service}
By exploiting vulnerabilities in the BitTorrent network, denial of service
attack can be directed at any machine connected to the internet, not just
machines in the network\cite{sia2006ddos}. The main idea is to report the victim
as the tracker (a server that coordinates the peers). El Defrawy, Gjoka and
Markopoulou created a small scale proof-of-concept attack. Using only one
machine, they could generate enough traffic to cripple small organisations and
home users. The authors suggested that if Sybils are created to perform the same
attack aimed at a single victim, then it could easily throttle links with much
higher bandwidth\cite{el2007bottorrent}.

Steiner et al. also succeeded in mounting a DDoS attack but using their in the
context of the aforementioned KAD DHT\cite{steiner2007exploiting}. Instead of
replying the correct list of peers to DHT queries, the Sybils always respond
with the IP address of the target peer in an attempt to overwhelm the target.
The authors show evidence that real-world malicious DDoS attacks involving more than
300,000 peers are mounted using P2P networks.

\subsubsection{Spying}
Many authors have used Sybils to monitor or spy a P2P file sharing network that
uses DHT\cite{holz2008measurements, steiner2007exploiting}. In essence, the
authors created a lot of light-weight Sybils and trick all the honest peers to
store them in their routing table, a form of index poisoning. The Sybils are
light-weight because do not follow the DHT protocol and perform much simpler
operations, thus a single machine can have thousands of Sybils running
simultaneously. Finally, DHT requests would ``pass through'' the Sybils due to
the poisoned routing table, and the requests can be stored in a database for
further analysis. 

\subsection{The Sybil Attack in OSN}
OSN (online social networks) are vulnerable to the Sybil attack even when most
of them use a central, trusted authority. In OSN, users create
profiles and form relationships with friends. In contrast with real world
relationships, it is much easier to create relationships in OSN even with
strangers. In 2008, Sophos conducted an experiment where they created a Facebook
profile and send friend requests to 200 random users, and 41\% of the users
accepted the friend request\cite{sophos}.

Many OSN in fact have a large number of Sybils. A report by Facebook at the end
of 2011 stated 5-6\% of their accounts are fake\cite{facebookfake}. Jiang et el.
analysed data from Renren\footnote{One of the largest social network in China.},
they discovered almost 1 million Sybils from 2440 Sybil
groups\cite{jiang2015understanding}.

Attackers leverage the ability to fool users into becoming one of their Sybil's
friend and the ability to create a large number of Sybils to mount a large
variety of attacks on the user. We outline the different types of attack in this
section. Note that online social networks often have a reputation aspect as
well, for example a Facebook page with a lot of fans may be considered to be
more reputable than others. We discuss attacks specific to OSN in this section
and attacks on reputation in \autoref{sec:reputation-attack}

\subsubsection{Identity Theft}
Authors of \cite{bilge2009all} created two attacks - profile cloning and
cross-site profile cloning, targeting five social network sites including
Facebook and LinkedIn. The iCloner system was created to automate these
attacks.

In profile cloning, iCloner uses publicly available information to automatically
create clones of the victim's profiles, effectively creating Sybils. iCloner
then sent friend requests from the cloned profile to the friends of the victim.
The fact that the victim may have many friends that they do not contact very
often, e.g. friend from primary school living in another country, makes this
attack highly effective. The authors found that the acceptance rate for cloned
profiles was over 60\%. Much higher than the acceptance rate of 30\% for
fictitious profiles. Once the friendship is established, it is possible to
extract private information that is not available publicly and perform identity
theft.

The idea of cross-site profile cloning is similar, except the cloned profile is
created on another social network site that the victim does not yet use. Once
the cloned profile is created, iCloner attempts to identify friends of the
victim and begins sending friend requests. Similarly, 56\% of the friend
requests were accepted. 

A more recent study created SbN (Socialbot Network) targeting
Facebook\cite{boshmaf2011socialbot}. Each socialbot is a Sybil created by the
attack, it controls a forged profile and minic human behaviour to avoid
detection. The attacker is the botmaster who coordinates the socialbots to
achieve a common objective such as infiltrating the target OSN by creating
friend relationships with real users. The authors found that infiltration
success rate was as high as 80\% and the FIS\cite{stein2011facebook} (Facebook
Immune System) was not sufficient to prevent the attack. Once the relationships
are established, the botmaster can command the socialbots to start gathering
private information which can then be used for identity theft.

% authors also said that Sybil detection based on attack edges is not effective
% because it's easy to create trust relationships with strangers

These examples demonstrate that the carelessness of users and the ability to
create Sybils makes OSN vulnerable to identity theft. Moreover, identity theft
is only an entry point. Once trust relationships are established, the attacker
can perform many other types of attacks such as spamming, phishing or
astroturfing to gain advantage.

\subsubsection{Astroturf}
Astroturfing is an act of creating grassroot movement that are in reality
carried out by a single entity, effectively spreading misinformation to
legitimate users. It relies on the ability to create Sybils in the underlying
social network. This type of attack is especially effective in social networks
such as Twitter where a lot of the social interaction such as sending messages
happen in the public.

In the 2010 Massachusetts senate race, Mustafaraj and Metaxas found evidence
that Republican campaingners created fake Twitter accounts and used them to send
spam. The spam caused Google real-time search results to tip in their favour
thus causing a spread of misinformation\cite{mustafaraj2010obscurity}.
Ratkiewicz et el. suggest that this type of attack can be mounted cheaply and
may have a larger influence than traditional
adversiting\cite{ratkiewicz2011truthy}.

The Truthy system\cite{ratkiewicz2011truthy} is a web service that perform
real-time analysis of Twitter to detect political astroturfing. In the 2010
U.S. midterm election, the authors found accounts which generated a lot of
retweets but no original tweets. More importantly, they uncovered a network of
bot accounts that injected thousands of tweets to smear the Democratic candidate.

In 2012, Wang et el. investigated two of the largeset
crowdturfing\footnote{Crowdsourced astroturfing.} platforms in China that brings
together buyers and sellers - Zhubajie and Sandaha. One of their services is
perform astroturfing on Weibo (The Chinese Twitter). The authors found that the
5364 sellers collectively own 14151 Weibo accounts and the top 1\% of the
sellers own over 100 accounts. Furthermore, the business is growing and more
than \$4 million have been spent on these two platforms over five
years\cite{wang2012serf}.

\subsubsection{Spam}
Spamming, much like in the context of email, is the act of sending unsolicited
or undesire messages (spam). The goal of the attacker varies from advertisement
to phishing and spreading malicious software\cite{twittermalware1,
  twittermalware2}. Many studies have characterised the behaviour of the
spammers and found that many spammers are in fact
Sybils~\cite{stringhini2010detecting, yang2012analyzing, grier2010spam,
  jiang2015understanding}. More importantly, spamming is possibly the most
common attack in OSN. Jiang et el. analysed the malicious activities of the
Sybils and found propogating advertisement (at 32.8\%) is the most common
one\cite{jiang2015understanding}. Some authors have worked with the service
provide to close the spam accounts, but it is clearly not sufficient as we
described in \autoref{sec:motivation}.


\subsection{The Sybil Attack in Reputation Systems}
\label{sec:reputation-attack}
Reputation systems cultivate collaborative behaviour by allowing entities to
trust each other based on community feedback, usually in the form of a
reputation score. Entities decide whom to trust based on the reputation scores,
thus entities are also incentivised to behave honestly. Reputation systems are
found in many context. In e-commerce, namely eBay, researchers found that the
merchant's reputation ``is a statistically and economically significant
determinant of auction prices''\cite{houser2006reputation}, and ``buyers are
willing to pay 8.1\% more'' for goods sold buy a reputable
merchant\cite{resnick2006value}. The file sharing peer-to-peer network
BitTorrent uses tit-for-tat as an ephemeral reputation system to encourage peers
to upload in exchange for better download speeds\cite{cohen2003incentives}. The
aforementioned PageRank\cite{page1999pagerank} is also a reputation system, used
for ranking reputable websites higher in Google's search results.

Unfortunately, reputation systems are also vulnerable to the Sybil attack.
Worryingly, there appears to an industry built around it, and their products are
easily accessible in the clearnet. In this section, we describe practical
attacks on reputation systems.

\subsubsection{Self-promoting}
In self-promotion, the goal of the attacker is to illegitimately raise its own
reputation. A common way to perform self-promition is to create Sybils and have
them create positive reputation for the attacker's main identity.

Dini and Spagnolo studied the economics of buying reputation on eBay. The
authors discovered many cheap items (around \euro{0.7}) for sell are simply there to
boost feedback. For example, one of the item is titled ``Apple Cranberry Crisp
Recipe + 100\% Positive Feedback''. The authors successfully boosted their
feedback by purchasing such items. But they made an unsuccessful attempted to
place a bid on their own good with a fake account\cite{dini2009buying}.

% Christin crawed the Silk Road, the anonymous marketplace. The author
% \cite{christin2013traveling}

De Cristofaro et el. performed an emperical study on Facebook page promotion
using like farms\cite{de2014paying}. Some of the farms such as
\verb!SocialFormulae.com! are clearly operated by bots and the operator does not
attempt to hide it, others such as \verb!BoostLikes.com! tries to minic human
users. The authors purchased the ``1000 likes'' service on their empty Facebook pages.
In under a month, many empty pages have accumulated almost 1000 likes as
promised by the like farms. The authors empty accounts were not terminated. Only
a small number of the liker's account were terminated.

% \cite{soska2015measuring}

SEOClerks and MyCheapJobs are also evidences of marketplaces for self-promotion.
Some of the top services include ``1 million Twitter followers'' at \$849,
``1000+ Instagram followers'' at \$10 and so on. The revenues of those two
marketplaces are estimated to be at \$1.3 million and \$116 thousand,
respectively\cite{farooqi2015characterizing}. Although the authors did not
investigate the properties of the fake followers, there is little doubt that
many of accounts used in these services are Sybils.

\subsubsection{Slandering}
The goal of a slandering attack is to illegitimately produce negative feedback
to undermine the reputation of the target. It is easy to imagine the improvement
in effectiveness when using multiple Sybils. From the best of our knowledge,
there are no published studies on real-world slandering. But
research has shown having a negative feedback may harm the target's ability to
do business\cite{ba2002evidence}.

\subsubsection{Whitewashing}
In whitewashing, attackers abuse the reputation system for temporary gain and
then escape the consequences by joining the reputation system under a new
identity to shed their bad reputation. Clearly, whitewashing is only possible
when the Sybil attack is possible. Again, there are no studies on whitewashing
in the real-world. But many have suggested that it is feasible
attack\cite{hoffman2009survey, marti2006taxonomy}.

% system. 

\subsection{The Sybil Attack in WANET}
WANET (wireless ad-hoc networks) is a dynamic, self-configuring, self-healing
wireless network. Ad-hoc in this case means it does not rely on existing
infrastructure for the network to function. Each node in the network is
responsible for some general tasks such as routing, and some application
specific tasks such as gathering data from its sensors in the case of a sensor
network.

Akin to the other applications, an attacker in a WANET may own a single physical
node, but it may behave as if it were a large number of nodes. Many WANET
designs involve a reputation system\cite{ganeriwal2008reputation,
  buchegger2003robust}, thus the same attacks from
\autoref{sec:reputation-attack} applies here. In this section we describe the
WANET specific attacks. From the best of our knowledge WANET are not widely
deployed in practice, thus there is little research on real-world attacks.

\subsubsection{Unfair Resource Allocation}
Nodes in WANET often have limited resources such as bandwidth of the radio
channels. Resources such as these must be shared between the neighbours using
time slices. When the neighbours are Sybils, then the attacker can receive an
unfair amount of resource allocation and denies resources for the honest
nodes\cite{newsome2004sybil}. In contrast with the other attacks, this works
even when the Sybils are not behaving malicioiusly.

\subsubsection{Routing Disruption}
An important routing technique is multipath routing, data is routed using
multiple paths in the network for better fault-tolerance and bandwidth. However,
if Sybils are present in the network, then the different paths may in fact go
through the Sybils owned by the same attacker. Another technique geographic
routing, nodes route data depending on the geographic location of their
neighbours. Sybils in the network can be in more than one place at a time, thus
significant distrupting the routing algorithm\cite{karlof2003secure}.

\subsubsection{Spreading False Information}
Nodes often need to exchange information with each other to satisfy the
underlying requirements of the application. Some of the common tasks include
data aggregation, voting. With enough Sybils, it is possible to manipulate the
aggregated data or the poll to benefit the attacker. For example, sensor
networks may use a bollot to detect misbehaving nodes, the attack could use its
Sybils to claim that a honest node is misbehaving and have the other nodes expel
it from the network\cite{newsome2004sybil}.
